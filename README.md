# Object Identification Under Known Dynamics: A PIRNN Approach for UAV Classification

This repository contains the code, data, and methods needed to use a ResNet PINN (PIRNN) to classify UAVs based on their trajectory data. It includes the simulations for UAV trajectories as well as the PIRNN structure.

<!-- *Note: Certain code segments have been omitted due to ongoing manuscript reviews.* -->

## Project Structure 
- Fixed_wings / Helicopter / Quadcopter:
    - `FixedWingUAV.py`, `HelicopterUAV.py`, `quadcopter.py` - Modeling and dynamic characteristics of each UAV
    - `FW_ScenarioSampler.py`, `Heli_ScenarioSampler.py`, `Quad_ScenarioSampler.py`: Capture a wide range of flight conditions
    - `FW_traj_generator.py`, `Heli_traj_generator.py`, `Quad_traj_generator.py`: Simulate to generate multiple trajectories under diverse flight conditions.
    - `fw_dataset.npz`, `heli_dataset.npz`, `quad_dataset.npz`: A total of 1000 trajectories were stored for each UAV
- results: Include the pretrained model, recorded loss values, training loss plots, and normalized statistics for each UAV class.
- `Noise.py`: Generate gaussian/ uniform noise
- `PINN.py`: Neural network structure for the ResNet style PINN
- `PINN_Classifier.py`: PIRNN workflow/ pipeline
- `UAVDataset.py`: Create a structured dataset for each UAV type, compatible with neural network training requirements
- `data_distribution.py`: Apply PCA and t-SNE to reduce data to 2D form and visualize class separation
- `run_main.py`: Train the PIRNN, test its classification capability, and produce an evaluation summary
- `load_model.py`: Load the pretrained model and test for unseen trajectories

## How to Run

### Step 1: Setup

Download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NyiNyi-14/PINN_based_UAV_Classification.git
```

All scripts must reside in the same directory for proper execution.

### Step 2: Update the Working Directories

Before running the code, set the appropriate input and output paths in the scripts `FW_traj_generator.py`, `Heli_traj_generator.py`, `quadcopter.py`, `load_model.py`, and `run_main.py` to specify where the results should be saved.

### Step 3: Run the code

Run `run_main.py` to train your own PIRNN model with custom hyperparameters.

Run `load_model.py` to load the pretrained PIRNN model and test it on unseen UAV trajectories
